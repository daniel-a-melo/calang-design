### A simple and familiar C-like programming language optmized for happiness 

##### Strongly inspired by [wren](https://wren.io), some inspiration from [vlang](https://vlang.io/), [ziglang](https://ziglang.io)

###### Drivers

- C-like syntax
- Strong modularization, packaging and versioning story. Tightly integrated into the language
- Compiled to bytecode, but compilation step may be implicit. 
- Binary package distribution is a first-class citzen
- Tooling should evolve hand in hand with the compiler/runtime. Tooling should not be an after-thought. The language should be as simple as the tooling can support.

###### Non-goals

- Native compilation targets
- Being simple to embed the runtime is a "nice to have", but not a driver
- Being a pure functional language

##### Initial ideas

The ideas listed below are classified in a staged approach, where stage 0 would be the MVP.
